    This document provides
    a high-level explanation of the project''s functionality, detailing the application''s
    flow and its technical components.

    

    ## 1. Launching

    

    Upon
    launching the application, the splash screen appears, and the Discover scene
    loads. This scene handles app setup, including platform initialization, entitlement
    checks, and retrieval of the logged-in user''s information (username, profile
    picture) for sharing with other players. It also gathers system data (userId
    for Avatars and shared spatial anchors) and sets up the player rig for passthrough
    rendering.

    

    ## 2. New User Experience (Networking)

    

    First-time
    users see NUX panels that explain how to connect. These panels can be reset in
    the settings for future viewing.

    

    ## 3. Networking Choice

    

    After
    the NUX, an initial popup window appears. It includes an input field for the
    session name, three connection options (Host, Join, Join Remote), and a settings
    button.

    

    ### 3a. Host

    

    Clicking Host initiates a session.
    If the room isn''t set up, you must do so first. Once set, the layout loads via
    the Scene API, and you connect to the Photon session. If no session name is provided,
    a random one is generated.

    

    As a host, you create the ColocationDriver,
    a network component for colocation using the colocation package. This establishes
    a shared spatial anchor for other players to access. After creating the anchor,
    the player realigns to it.

    

    The host spawns the scene''s network
    objects (walls, ceiling, floor, desks, etc.) based on the room layout and loads
    any saved 3D icons.

    

    ### 3b. Join

    

    Players in the same
    room as the host can join as colocated. If not, they join as remote players.
    To join, input the session name and click Join, connecting to the Photon session.
    The ColocationDriver, already on the network, spawns, and the system attempts
    colocation. A request is sent to the host to share the anchor. Once shared, the
    player accesses and loads it, realigning to the anchor to match the host''s frame
    of reference.

    

    All scene objects load once the player joins the Photon
    session.

    

    ### 3c. Join Remote

    

    For players not in the
    same space, they join as Avatars in the colocated session. They see others as
    Avatars and can locomote using controllers or hand gestures, accommodating different
    room sizes.

    

    The ColocationDriver skips colocation setup when joining
    remotely.

    

    All scene objects load once the player joins the Photon
    session.

    

    ### 3d. Settings

    

    Here, you can reset the NUX
    and choose a networking region if connecting remotely to a host in a different
    region. By default, it selects the Best region with the least latency.

    

    ##
    4. Application NUX

    

    After selecting a session joining method, first-time
    users see a panel explaining the application''s functionality before connecting.
    This can be reset in the settings.

    

    ## 5. Place/Move Icons

    

    Once
    connected, icons can be placed and moved. The host and colocated users can place
    icons in their space. Open the Menu with the left-hand menu button. If an application
    isn''t placed, click the icon to start the placement flow.

    

    A puck
    with the icon hovers, indicating allowed placement surfaces. If allowed, click
    with your index (or pinch with hand tracking) to place it. Rotate the icon using
    the joystick or by moving your hand while pinching.

    

    To move icons,
    point at a 3D icon and long press. A move icon appears; release to enter the
    placement flow.

    

    Once placed, icons are saved on disk for future
    sessions, anchored in the scene with spatial anchors. The anchor and app data
    are saved for reloading in the same spot.

    

    ## 6. Launch Applications

    

    Once
    an icon is placed, anyone can launch the application by clicking the icon in
    the menu or the 3D icon in the space.

    

    Applications are networked
    containers with application logic. The host spawns the application, and everyone
    sees it. Anyone can close the application from the menu.

    

    Each application
    has its own logic and setup.

    

    ## 7. Menu

    

    The menu includes
    several panels:

    

    * Apps: Launch or place an application.

    *
    Settings: Reset NUX, clear saved 3D Icons position, leave the session.

    *
    Info: Discover application and networking information.

    * Scene: Toggle
    scene highlight.

    

    The menu''s bottom bar displays the room session
    name, time, and battery level.
