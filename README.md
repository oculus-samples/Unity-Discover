# Discover

Discover is a Mixed Reality (MR) project demonstrating how to use key MR features and integrate them into your own project.

This codebase serves as both a reference and a template for MR projects. You can test the game on [Meta Horizon Store - Discover](https://www.meta.com/experiences/discover/7041851792509764/).

## Project Description

This project showcases the use of Scene API, Interaction SDK, Passthrough, Spatial Anchors, and Shared Spatial Anchors.

It was built using the [Unity engine](https://unity.com/) with [Photon Fusion](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/fusion-intro). It also includes the [Meta Utilities](./Packages/com.meta.utilities/README.md), [Meta Input Utilities](./Packages/com.meta.utilities.input/README.md), and [Meta Avatars Utilities](./Packages/com.meta.utilities.avatars/README.md) packages, which contain useful tools and methods.

## How to Run the Project in Unity

1. [Configure the project](./Documentation/Configuration.md) with Meta Quest and Photon
2. Make sure you're using  *Unity 6000.0.50f1* or newer.
3. Load the [Assets/Discover/Scenes/Discover](./Assets/Discover/Scenes/Discover.unity) scene.
4. To test in the Editor, you'll need to use Quest Link:
    <details>
      <summary><b>Quest Link</b></summary>

    - Enable Quest Link:
        - Put on your headset, navigate to "Quick Settings", and select "Quest Link" (or "Quest Air Link" if using Air Link).
        - Select your desktop from the list, then select "Launch". This launches the Quest Link app, allowing you to control your desktop from your headset.
    - With the headset on, select "Desktop" from the control panel in front of you. You should see your desktop in VR.
    - Navigate to Unity and press "Play"; the application should launch on your headset automatically.
    </details>
